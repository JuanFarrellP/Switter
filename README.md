# Switter (switter)

A Twitter-like social media project. This is my first project with Vue.js that I learned by following https://youtu.be/la-0ulfn0_M.
The video used an older version of Vue.js, which became a challenge for me while I developed this project.
Currently, I'm aiming to add more features that are not listed in the video.

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```

### Format the files

```bash
yarn format
# or
npm run format
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).
